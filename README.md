**Rho** was derived from *Rhododendron* after I discovered the existence of these beautiful flowers in a bedtime story.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 A simple reading companion backed by [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases)

- ✅ Track your read / unread posts

## 🧪 Status

Rho Reader is under active development and not yet published in the Obsidian community plugin store.

## 🛠️ Installation

Since the plugin is still early-stage, you’ll need to install it manually:

```bash
cd <path-to-your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins
git clone git@github.com:scriptnull/rho-reader.git
cd rho-reader
npm install
npm run build
```
